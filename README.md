# FlightFarePrediction

This project uses historical flight data, to create a model that can predict flight fares across various cities in India.
First the data is pre-processed to make it model ready. Then several Machine Learning algorithms are used to fit the data, 
and the one with the best accuracy is selected. Also, hyperparameter tuning methods are applied to increase model efficiency.
